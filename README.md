# Stardust Portfolio - Whimsical Portfolio Website ‚ú®üé®üßÄ

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website! This project is a vibrant showcase of my creative endeavors as a whimsical illustrator, cosmic dreamer, and aspiring web developer.

* **Hero Section:** A warm welcome introducing myself and my creative passions.
* **Portfolio Gallery:** A curated selection of my artwork, depicting my hobbies.
* **About Me Section:** A two-column layout featuring an illustration and a glimpse into my world as an artist, aspiring sci-fi author (exploring AI and imagination in my ACoAM series!), and a dedicated learner of JavaScript, React, and Python.
* **Contact Section** Placeholder details for getting in touch.
* **Starry Background:** A beautiful, animated starry background to set a cosmic mood.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üöÄ Journey & Future Plans

* This portfolio represents a significant step in my journey from completing HTML/CSS courses to mastering JavaScript and beyond. It's a project I plan to iterate on as my skills grow. Future enhancements might include a functional contact form, more interactive elements, and perhaps even a blog section to share my thoughts on art, code, and cheese!

* Thank you for visiting and exploring my little corner of the cosmos!

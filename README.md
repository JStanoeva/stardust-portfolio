# üí´ Stardust Portfolio Website ‚ú®üé®üßÄ

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website! This project is a vibrant showcase of my creative endeavors as a whimsical illustrator, cosmic dreamer, and aspiring web developer.

## üíñ About This Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to be a cozy corner of the internet where I can share my art, my journey into the world of web development, and a little bit about myself. It reflects my love for cats, cosmic themes, cheese-themed art, and my mission (as Queen Tora of the Cheese Republic, alongside King Orion!) to 'cheesify the universe' by spreading joy, kindness, and creativity.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Features:

- **Hero Section:** A warm welcome introducing myself and my creative passions.
- **Portfolio Gallery:** A curated selection of my artwork, including:
  - "Cat petting" ‚Äì celebrating feline floofiness!
  - "Black hole booping" ‚Äì a touch of dangerous cosmic whimsy!
  - "Cheesing" ‚Äì pure, unadulterated cheese-themed joy!
  - Interactive hover effects with image zoom, brightening, and title reveal.
- **About Me Section:** A two-column layout featuring an illustration and a glimpse into my world as an artist, aspiring sci-fi author, and a dedicated learner of JavaScript, React, and Python.
- **Contact Section:** Placeholder details for getting in touch.
- **Dynamic Elements:**
  - A beautiful, animated starry background to set a cosmic mood.
  - Smooth scrolling navigation for an elegant user experience.
  - An automatically updating copyright year in the footer.
- **Responsive Design:** Crafted to look good across various screen sizes (though always a work in progress!).

## üõ† Tech Stack:

This website is built with a blend of foundational and modern web technologies:

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
- **CSS3:** For all the styling, including:
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first framework for rapid and responsive design.
  - **Custom CSS:** For bespoke styles like the gradient background, star animations, and specific hover effects.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** To power the dynamic starry background and the automatically updating copyright year.
- **Google Fonts:** Utilizing the "Open Sans" font for a clean and friendly typographic feel.

## üöÄ Journey & Future Plans:

This portfolio represents a significant step in my journey from completing HTML/CSS courses to mastering JavaScript and beyond. It's a project I plan to iterate on as my skills grow. Future enhancements might include a functional contact form, more interactive elements, and perhaps even a blog section to share my thoughts on art, code, and cheese!

Thank you for visiting and exploring my little corner of the cosmos!
